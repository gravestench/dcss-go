-- Polyphemus (MONS_POLYPHEMUS) is a DCSS monster profile with 16 hit dice and
-- speed 10.
-- Its first melee contact is AT_HIT for 45 base damage; combat policy applies
-- defenses and status effects.
-- The AI consults MST_POLYPHEMUS when choosing a legal spell, then spends
-- this actor's saved energy.
